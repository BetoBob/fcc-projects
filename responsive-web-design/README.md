# Responsive Web Design

## IDE Choice

Sadly, the Live IDE I used to use (Brackets) is no longer supported by Adobe. It has become open source, so it might get some support in the future, but for now I will assume that it's not a tool I want to continue learning for future use.

The recommended alternative was using Atom or VS Code. The intellisense for code syntax completion are pretty good as expected, but live preview is a missing feature. These free IDEs offer community plugins for live HTML preview, however I have tested them and they are pretty bad. For now, I will just need to load the `index.html` file in a web browser and reload the page when I want to test it.

In the future, I might want to consider making a simple plugin that opens the web page in a browser, and automatically reloads the page anytime a user makes an edit in the code. This might exist already and I just need to a little more digging, but if not this could be a fun side project that would look good on a resume.
