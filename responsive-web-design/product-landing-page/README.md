# Product Landing Page

* [sample FCC page](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/RKRbwL)
* ALT + Shift + 5 for strikethrough
  * alternative, use `~~content~~` 

## User Stories

### header

1. ~~My product landing page should have a `header` element with a corresponding `id="header"`.~~

2. ~~I can see an image within the `header` element with a corresponding `id="header-img"`. A company logo would make a good image here.~~

#### nav-bar

3. ~~Within the `#header` element I can see a `nav` element with a corresponding `id="nav-bar"`.~~

4. ~~I can see at least three clickable elements inside the `nav` element, each with the class `nav-link`.~~

5. ~~When I click a `.nav-link` button in the `nav` element, I am taken to the corresponding section of the landing page.~~

13. ~~The navbar should always be at the top of the viewport.~~

### form

7. My landing page has a `form` element with a corresponding `id="form"`.
8. Within the form, there is an `input` field with `id="email"` where I can enter an email address.
9. The `#email` input field should have placeholder text to let the user know what the field is for.
10. The `#email` input field uses HTML5 validation to confirm that the entered text is an email address.
11. Within the form, there is a submit `input` with a corresponding `id="submit"`.
12. When I click the `#submit` element, the email is submitted to a static page (use this mock URL: https://www.freecodecamp.com/email-submit).

### other

6. ~~I can watch an embedded product video with `id="video"`.~~

14. ~~My product landing page should have at least one media query.~~
15. My product landing page should utilize CSS flexbox at least once.

## layout

I think I am going to do the bakery theme again, only this time using Scornovacca's Bakery as a reference. I can use the menu of the bakery as a reference.

### Home 

* description of restaurant
* email fill-out
* embed a map

I'd prefer to have a professional video of the bakery here, but the only video I could find that was Scorno's related was for Scorno's pizza. So for now I am just going to have a vintage video of Scorno's pizza at the bottom of the page.

### Menu

* left side is pastery menu

* right side is lunch menu 

Honestly seems kind of barren, might want to animate the menus to enlarge them or something. Make sure the max sizes are the same.

### Photos

I am going to start by using flexbox to show a couple of embeded content photos from the bakery:

In the future though, I would prefer to have a photo album to show these posts. Just because I think it would look better.

## resources

* [CSS Font-Size: em vs. px vs. pt vs. percent](https://kyleschaeffer.com/css-font-size-em-vs-px-vs-pt-vs-percent)
  * I am going to try using `em` rather than `px` for this project to see how better it scales
